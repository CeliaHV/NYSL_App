In this project, I'm an independent developer the Northside Youth Soccer League (NYSL) has hired to create an app to give their players and parents easy on-the-go access to the league's game schedules. To avoid the hassles of native apps, they would like this to be a mobile web app. I've designed and developed the mobile web app, and added features to the app that are specific to mobile devices, such as location-based features so parents can see where they are in relation to the soccer field.

Mobile Web Application Development is the process of creating or updating web-based applications or websites to be optimally viewable and functional within a mobile device's browser. This process includes:
- Using new features in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to make the mobile web app look and feel like a native mobile application.
- Creating a responsive design that works for various screen sizes and rotations.
- Taking advantage of specific capabilities of smartphones such as location-awareness.
